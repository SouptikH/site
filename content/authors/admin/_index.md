Welcome!

I am a postgraduate student at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, passionate about designing scalable and efficient algorithms to tackle computationally hard problems. My research focuses on pushing the boundaries of algorithmic design, and you can find a more detailed overview in my resume.

Beyond my core research, I am deeply fascinated by Mathematics, Astrophysics, Molecular Biology, and many other disciplines that unveil the intricacies of our universe. I aspire to explore the intersection of these fields with Computer Science, striving to unlock new insights and possibilities.

My ultimate goal is to contribute to a deeper understanding of the laws of nature and to play a role in building a sustainable future for life on Earth.
